## Learning Objectives
*At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google***
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use `system`
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl)

## Tasks
**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the numbr stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
* You can find the source code here [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
 * The variable `n` will stoe a different value everty time you run this program
 * You don't have to understand what `rand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
 * Th eoutput of the program should be:
               * The number, followed by
                     * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
                     * If the number is 0: `is zero`
                     * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`
               * followed by a new line
* File: [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c)
